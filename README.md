## Note

This xontrib is using [xonsh sqlite history backend](https://xon.sh/tutorial_hist.html#sqlite-history-backend) to get statistics by directories you're used to run commands.

## Installation

To install use pip:

```bash
xpip install xontrib-jump-to-dir
# OR: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/anki-code/xontrib-jump-to-dir
```

## Usage

```xsh
# Check that you're using sqlite history in ~/.xonshrc
$XONSH_HISTORY_BACKEND = 'sqlite'

xontrib load jump_to_dir

mkdir -p /tmp/hello /tmp/world
cd /tmp/hello
echo 1
echo 2
echo 3
cd /tmp/world
echo 1
cd /

j           # Jump to most frequent directory i.e. `/tmp/hello` because 3 `echo` commands were executed
j wor       # Jump to directory with `*wor*` in path i.e. `/tmp/world`
j t he      # Jump to directory with `*t*he*` in path i.e. `/tmp/hello`
```

Custom shortcut:
```xsh
$XONTRIB_JUMP_TO_DIR_SHORTCUT = 'z'
xontrib load jump_to_dir
z tm  # Jump to `*tm*`
```
